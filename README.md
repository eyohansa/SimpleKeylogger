# SimpleKeylogger
A C# keylogger based on simple keylogger by Mr Falkreath.

Compile with Visual Studio Community 2015 and run the .exe from Debug/Release folder. See the generated log.txt in the same folder for captured keys.

You can terminate process through Task Manager (It should say SimpleKeylogger (32-bit)).
